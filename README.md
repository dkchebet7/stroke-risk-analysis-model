# Stroke Risk Prediction Model

This project is a replication and portfolio-ready version of my undergraduate research paper:  
**"Assessing and Modelling the Risk Factors of Stroke Using Multiple Logistic Regression Modelling; A Case Study in Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH), Eldoret."**

The original study was based on clinical data collected at MTRH and was presented at the **13th JKUAT Scientific, Technological and Industrialization Conference and Exhibition**. The project was also shortlisted for publication by the *South Florida Journal of Development*.

## üìå Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates how multiple logistic regression can be used to assess the risk factors contributing to stroke. Although the original dataset from the hospital is not included for privacy reasons, this project simulates a similar structure with synthetic data to illustrate the modeling approach, key findings, and visualizations.

##  Objectives

- Identify significant health and demographic predictors of stroke
- Use logistic regression to estimate the risk of stroke occurrence
- Visualize key relationships between risk factors and stroke likelihood
- Simulate an academic research pipeline using Python

##  Key Highlights

- **Research-backed**: Based on real-world data collected during a clinical study at MTRH
- **Model-driven**: Built using multiple logistic regression techniques
- **Insightful**: Includes data visualization and model interpretation
- **Portfolio-ready**: Reconstructed with synthetic data for ethical sharing

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Model Evaluation)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

##  Outputs

- Synthetic dataset simulating key features (age, hypertension, smoking status, etc.)
- Logistic regression summary table
- Visualizations of correlation, distributions, and coefficients
- Confusion matrix and classification report

## üìÅ File Structure

- `Stroke_Risk_Regression.ipynb` ‚Äî Main notebook with code and analysis  
- `data/synthetic_stroke_data.csv` ‚Äî Simulated data mimicking hospital dataset structure  
- `assets/` ‚Äî Visuals used in the notebook or presentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

The original dataset from Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) is not included to protect patient privacy. All data used in this repository is synthetic but structurally similar to the real dataset used in the academic study.
